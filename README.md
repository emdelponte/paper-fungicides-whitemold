# Reproducible report: Network meta-analysis of fungicide effects on white mold epidemics and soybean yield

This repository contains all files required to reproduce the computational work in a research article, including all data and R scripts, entitled "Performance and profitability of fungicides for managing soybean white mold: 10-year summary of cooperative trials". The article is the main outcome of a MSc thesis defended by Jhonatan Paulo Barro, an M.Sc. student of the Graduate Program in Plant Pathology, under the supervision of Prof. Emerson Del Ponte, Universidade Federal de Viçosa.

# Reproducible analysis report

A website was constructed to describe in detail the data and all steps of the statistical analysis

# Overview of contents

The root of the repository contains files that set the website structure (menus, etc.) and style  (`.yml`, `.css`), as well as the citation/reference style. There are four `.Rmd` files that generates each html, which are separated according to the convention of a research compendium.

- `index.Rmd`: Describes the research, objectives, authorship, etc.
- `data.Rmd`: Contains the raw or raw-derived data.
- `code-xxx.Rmd` files: Provides documents scripts for conducting the analysis


There are three basic folders:

- `data/` - raw and further processed data.
- `docs/` - html files of the reproducible report with all text and figures.
- `Figures`/ - folder to place the figures generated in R
- `Preprint/` - A PDF version of the accepted manuscript
