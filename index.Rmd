<img src = "Figures/Fig2.png" width = 350px align = right> This website describes in details data and all steps of the statistical analysis for a study conducted by Jhonatan Paulo Barro, an M.Sc. student of the Graduate Program in Plant Pathology, under the supervision of Prof. Emerson Del Ponte, Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa.



The objective of the research was to summarize, using meta-analytic approaches, soybean yield response to some fungicides, which have been used to reduce incidence of white mold disease (caused by the fungus *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*), evaluated during 10 years and multiple sites in Brazil. In addition, the economic benefits were explored using the mean and respective variances of the meta-analytic estimates of yield response to calculate the probability of breaking-even on costs for a range of scenarios of soybean prices and fungicide costs.
